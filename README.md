# BERTRAM + BEAN Standard Web Components

> **NOTE:** Until this reaches at least 0.1.0, this should be regarded as a work in progress - grab whatever code you want, but don't use it as-is.

## Motivation

Rather than reinvent the wheel, we at BERTRAM + BEAN have a store of generally useful components for use by
BERTRAM + BEAN's devs. Things like nav tabs, an MDI JS icon wrapper, our home-grown Captcha, etc.

Anyone is welcome to use these components, but be aware that they are specifically made for
people who work for BERTRAM + BEAN, so you may need to modify them to make them work best
for you.

All components use standard CSS classes though there are occasional hints that we actually use TailwindCSS
in house.

## Licencing

All code is shared under the MIT licence.

We endeavour to cite our code sources where possible but, for safety's sake, please assume we've
borrowed code from all over the place, mashed it to do what we want, and shared it again.
To our knowledge all code here is free for use in commercial projects.

Uses modified versions of `vue-ripple-directive` and `vue-tabs-with-active-line`, which can both
be found on NPM.

## Getting started

```
npm i bertramandbean-component-library
```

or

```
yarn add bertramandbean-component-library
```

(Staff FYI - the library uses NPM rather than Yarn.)
